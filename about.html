Description:
Hello

Hi I'm Kinngginger an internet comedian.
I make roblox tts videos and more. I'm actually an artist and game developer!

Nature loves me for a simple lot
To find the lesson my rhymes are taught.

Put my last line on the book of time,
Give them their Tea through every clime.

Leave all our Teacups for the rest,
Spring must join in a bloom in the west.

"I might sound cheesy, but if you never do something, you'll never succeed."-Kinngginger
okay bye :)

Inspired by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Philip Freneau, and Edgar Allan Poe

Ayo make's video's on saturday every 2 weeks
